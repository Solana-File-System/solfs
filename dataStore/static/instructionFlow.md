# Instruction Flow Documentation

## Overview
The diagram begins at the `process_instruction` function, which deserializes the incoming instruction data and then routes the flow based on the instruction type.

## Instruction Branches
Each branch represents one of the instruction variants:

### InitializeDataStore
- Retrieves necessary accounts
- Creates or reassigns the data account
- Zeroes out its data
- Generates and validates the PDA for metadata
- Creates the metadata account
- Serializes initial metadata

### UpdateDataStore
- Validates account signatures and writability
- Deserializes metadata (ensuring that it's initialized and not finalized)
- Validates the authority and PDA
- Checks if data reallocation is needed
- Updates the data

### UpdateDataStoreAuthority
- Validates accounts
- Deserializes metadata
- Ensures proper authorization
- Updates the authority in the metadata

### FinalizeDataStore
- Validates account statuses
- Deserializes metadata
- Verifies authority and PDA
- Marks the data as finalized

### CloseDataStore
- Validates accounts
- Transfers lamports from the metadata and data accounts back to the authority
- Resets account data
